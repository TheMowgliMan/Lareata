# Lareata
A 2D Terraria-like sandbox game.

This game currently has:

 - Dummy scrolling player controller

## Installation Instructions
This requires Godot to be installed.

 1. Click "Download Zip" on Github.
 2. Navigate in your file explorer to the Download folder of your browser, and uncompress Lareata-main.zip. If you got this package from a fork, it will say something other than "-main" at the end.
 3. Move the folder "Lareata" from your just-unpacked .zip, and put it into your default Godot Projects folder.
 4. Enter Godot, and click "scan" in the sidebar to the right.
 5. Navigate to the Lareata folder you just moved, and select it.
 6. Click "Select Current Folder", and Lareata should be present in your project list.
